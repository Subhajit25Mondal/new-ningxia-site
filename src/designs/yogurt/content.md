# Yogurt

### A Chrome extension that helps you understand your browsing behavior and reduce distraction.

Yogurt is a Chrome extension. By visualizing personal browsing history in an elegant and non-intrusive way, it raises awareness of online distraction and fosters healthy information diet. It employs a new visualization technique named Barcode Chart that we designed specifically for this purpose. With meaningful statistics and rich mouseover interactions, it better informs the user his/her personal browsing patterns and it's left for the user to decide whether he/she should adjust his/her behavior. What sites are distracting and how much they distract are totally customized by the user. It also has cool features such as changing different color themes and saving the beautiful, personal visualizations as unique wallpapers.

You can find more about Yogurt and actually try using it here!

It's made amazing by me and three other partners, as the final project for CS448B Data Visualization at Stanford, using Web SQL and D3.

My contribution to Yogurt is visualization design, interaction design (interaction flows, mouseover and transitions), graphic design (including logo, fontface and color), some d3 and Javascript coding and document writing.

Recently, Yogurt has been accepted as a poster at UIST 2013 conference at St. Andrews, Scotland. You can find the paper Visualizing web browsing history with barcode chart here.
