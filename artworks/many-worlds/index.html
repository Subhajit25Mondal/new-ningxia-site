<p><img alt="Many Worlds" title="Many Worlds" src="../../images/artworks/many_worlds-1.jpg"></p>

<p>There’s an theory in quantum mechanics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">Many Worlds</a>. It implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual “world” (or “universe”). The concept is fascinating and very interesting to pursue, given the prompt of dimensionalized time. Meanwhile, I wanted to express it in something tangible, and spatially explorable.</p>

<p>I then decided to make a paper tree expanding on a plane, with the story of a dot having different experiences in different universes. The story being abstract came very naturally to my mind, as this is such a philosophical concept about universe and time, it should be as generic as it can be. Abstract shapes are aesthetically simple, and also allow for larger space for interpretation.</p>

<p>As I brainstormed ideas for the stories, I found myself imposing connotations on them. The dot is like one of us, who meets different kind of people, the dot can be influenced by them or influence them. He also gets into different situations, and his different reactions will lead him into different worlds.</p>

<p><img alt="Many Worlds" title="Many Worlds" src="../../images/artworks/many_worlds-2.jpg"></p>

<p>The final stories are:</p>

<ul><li>The dot meets three lines, and the lines transform the dot into a triangle</li><li>The dot gets wrapped by a net,<ul><li>it becomes bigger and gets rid of the constraints of the net</li><li>the net contracts and divided the dot into 6 smaller ones</li></ul></li><li>The dot meets a triangle and gets on top of it,<ul><li>the triangle then moves, making the dot fall on the ground in pieces</li><li>the triangle made a dent in the dot, and finally makes it into a spiky shape</li></ul></li><li>The dot melts and gets accumulated in a glass. The black liquid then
evaporates, leaving the glass alone</li><li>The dot gets peeled, showing the red dot inside,<ul><li>the cap on top of the dot is opened, and it pours out lots of water</li><li>it breaks in halves, with fire inside that burns everything</li></ul></li></ul>
